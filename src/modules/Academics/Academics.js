             <h5> LEELA’S SCHOOL: BALANCED DEVELOPMENT</h5>
             At LEELA’S SCHOOL, we focus on the balanced enhancement of life skills and intellectual skills. The ‘problems of life,’ much like academic challenges, are tailored to the child’s age. Through guided problem-solving based on the principles of ‘Transfer of Learning,’ students develop a problem-solving mindset that benefits both their academic syllabus and real-world challenges.
Our academic process successfully harmonizes games and studies, ensuring that learning is engaging and meaningful. LEELA’S SCHOOL believes that combining play and entertainment with thinking, planning, reasoning, and purpose-driven learning directly contributes to improved academic performance and examination results.
<br/><br/>
<h5> Academic & Emotional Development</h5>
The first few years of a child’s life in preschool shape their academic, social, and emotional future. Our Nursery-KGII Programme is designed to create a learning environment that accommodates individual learners, providing them with opportunities to maximize their potential.
This high-quality educational program fosters children’s language, literacy, numeracy, emotional well-being, universal values, and creative skills. Our vision is to embrace the latest teaching techniques and introduce them successfully in India and worldwide.
The Montessori curriculum at LEELA’S KIDS enhances learning through innovative teaching methodologies, making us the leading kindergarten education provider in Kanhan.
<br/><br/>
<h5>Montessori Lab</h5>
The Montessori Lab, an integral part of our school, offers a dynamic, hands-on learning space that promotes child-centered education. Rooted in independence, exploration, and respect for natural development, this space encourages students to engage in self-directed learning.
Designed for various age groups and developmental stages, the lab provides tailored materials that spark curiosity and critical thinking.
<br/><br/>
